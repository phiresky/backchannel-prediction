You will need the switchboard audio files from <https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc97s62>. These are sadly not openly available, but your institution might have an LDC license.

If you are running on the ISL cluster:

	ln -s /project/earsData/swbLinks adc

The ISL utterance database (should not be needed anymore, replaced by the ISIP transcriptions)

	ln -s /project/ears2/db/train/ db

The original transcriptions are from <https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/switchboard/>

	scripts/getdata.sh
	
You can compare the integrity of the data files with the ones I used by running

    sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt

The utterance_is_backchannel.json contains a dump of backchannel vs non-backchannel data for all utterances in Switchboard, generated by `python -m extract.standalone_save_backchannels_to_json`.
