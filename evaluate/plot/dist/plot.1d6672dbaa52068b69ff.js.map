The viewmodel proxies all enumerable property of the original model with the following behavior:\n *  - as long as no new value has been assigned to the viewmodel property, the original property will be returned.\n *  - any future change in the model will be visible in the viewmodel as well unless the viewmodel property was dirty at the time of the attempted change.\n *  - once a new value has been assigned to a property of the viewmodel, that value will be returned during a read of that property in the future. However, the original model remain untouched until `submit()` is called.\n *\n * The viewmodel exposes the following additional methods, besides all the enumerable properties of the model:\n * - `submit()`: copies all the values of the viewmodel to the model and resets the state\n * - `reset()`: resets the state of the viewmodel, abandoning all local modifications\n * - `resetProperty(propName)`: resets the specified property of the viewmodel\n * - `isDirty`: observable property indicating if the viewModel contains any modifications\n * - `isPropertyDirty(propName)`: returns true if the specified property is dirty\n * - `model`: The original model object for which this viewModel was created\n *\n * You may use observable arrays, maps and objects with `createViewModel` but keep in mind to assign fresh instances of those to the viewmodel's properties, otherwise you would end up modifying the properties of the original model.\n * Note that if you read a non-dirty property, viewmodel only proxies the read to the model. You therefore need to assign a fresh instance not only the first time you make the assignment but also after calling `reset()` or `submit()`.\n *\n * @example\n * class Todo {\n *   \\@observable title = \"Test\"\n * }\n *\n * const model = new Todo()\n * const viewModel = createViewModel(model);\n *\n * autorun(() => console.log(viewModel.model.title, \",\", viewModel.title))\n * // prints \"Test, Test\"\n * model.title = \"Get coffee\"\n * // prints \"Get coffee, Get coffee\", viewModel just proxies to model\n * viewModel.title = \"Get tea\"\n * // prints \"Get coffee, Get tea\", viewModel's title is now dirty, and the local value will be printed\n * viewModel.submit()\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get tea\", changes submitted from the viewModel to the model, viewModel is proxying again\n * viewModel.title = \"Get cookie\"\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get cookie\" // viewModel has diverged again\n * viewModel.reset()\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get tea\", changes of the viewModel have been abandoned\n *\n * @param {T} model\n * @returns {(T & IViewModel<T>)}\n * ```\n */\nfunction createViewModel(model) {\n    return new ViewModel(model);\n}\nexports.createViewModel = createViewModel;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/mobx-utils/lib/create-view-model.js\n// module id = 638\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar mobx_1 = require(\"mobx\");\nvar utils_1 = require(\"./utils\");\nexports.PENDING = \"pending\";\nexports.FULFILLED = \"fulfilled\";\nexports.REJECTED = \"rejected\";\nvar PromiseBasedObservable = (function () {\n    function PromiseBasedObservable(promise, initialValue) {\n        if (initialValue === void 0) { initialValue = undefined; }\n        var _this = this;\n        this.promise = promise;\n        this._state = mobx_1.observable(exports.PENDING); // MWE: Hm... as any should not be needed...\n        this._reason = mobx_1.observable.shallowBox(undefined);\n        this._observable = mobx_1.observable.box(initialValue);\n        promise.then(mobx_1.action(\"observableFromPromise-resolve\", function (value) {\n            _this._observable.set(value);\n            _this._state.set(\"fulfilled\");\n        }), mobx_1.action(\"observableFromPromise-reject\", function (reason) {\n            _this._reason.set(reason);\n            _this._observable.set(reason);\n            _this._state.set(\"rejected\");\n        }));\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(PromiseBasedObservable.prototype, \"value\", {\n        get: function () {\n            return this._observable.get();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(PromiseBasedObservable.prototype, \"state\", {\n        get: function () {\n            return this._state.get();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(PromiseBasedObservable.prototype, \"reason\", {\n        get: function () {\n            utils_1.deprecated(\"In `fromPromise`: `.reason` is deprecated, use `.value` instead\");\n            return this._reason.get();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    PromiseBasedObservable.prototype.case = function (handlers) {\n        switch (this.state) {\n            case \"pending\": return handlers.pending && handlers.pending();\n            case \"rejected\": return handlers.rejected && handlers.rejected(this.value);\n            case \"fulfilled\": return handlers.fulfilled && handlers.fulfilled(this.value);\n        }\n    };\n    return PromiseBasedObservable;\n}());\n/**\n * `fromPromise` takes a Promise and returns an object with 3 observable properties that track\n * the status of the promise.
